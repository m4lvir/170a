        <h2>Topic 2: Best Practices for Code Review</h2>
        <p>Advice received: Focus on intent and logic first. Use automated linting for style issues so you can concentrate on the architecture and security implications.</p>

        <h2>Topic 3: Strategies for Mastering the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) from Joshua</h2>
        
       <p>The MDMP can feel overwhelming due to the sheer volume of information, symbology, and interconnected FMs. Applying constant repetition helps, as MDMP is a muscle that benefits from regular cycles.</p>

        <h3>Actionable Strategies to making MDMP easier:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Visual Aids and Mapping**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Create mind maps or flowcharts for each step to visualize connections and processes.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li>Use colors and symbols to categorize tasks (e.g., reconnaissance, logistics) to simplify the mental workload.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Practical Application**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Run simple, real-world problems (like a road trip) through the MDMP framework to make the concepts feel natural before diving into military complexities.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li>Participate in exercises, simulations, or Capture The Flag (CTF)-type events to bridge the gap between theory and practice.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Chunking the Material**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Break MDMP into its individual steps (e.g., mission analysis, COA development) and focus on truly understanding one step at a time.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li>Prioritize key outputs and their purpose (e.g., the aim of the Mission Analysis Brief)[cite: 22].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Cross-Referencing Strategically**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Instead of jumping back and forth through Field Manuals (FMs), **build a personal reference guide** by summarizing key points from each FM in your own words.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li>Use digital tools or bookmarks to tag frequently referenced sections to save time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Cycles and Reflection**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>After every MDMP iteration, carve out time to **reflect** on what worked, what felt clunky, and what made you pause.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li>Keep a journal or quick "after-action" cheat sheet to track reflections and fine-tune your process.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Leverage Peer Support**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Discuss MDMP concepts with colleagues from varied branches or compositions, as their perspective can introduce unique insights.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li>Explaining concepts to others often leads to a deeper, more personal understanding.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Mnemonics and Acronyms**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Develop your own shortcuts to remember key symbology or outputs at each stage, creating a personal "language" for faster retrieval.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Immerse in Real Scenarios**
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li>Deconstruct how successful or failed historical operations utilized MDMP to help drive retention, as the practical stakes help align theoretical knowledge with real-world challenges.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
